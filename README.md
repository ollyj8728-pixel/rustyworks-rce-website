# RustyWorks RCE — website

Static marketing site for **RustyWorks RCE**, the free Discord bot for Rust Console
Edition servers. Plain HTML, CSS and browser JavaScript — no build step beyond copying
`public/` into the deployable bundle.

## Structure

```
public/
  index.html            Homepage markup
  style.css             Full site stylesheet (theme tokens, every page, seasonal themes)
  sections.css          Homepage scene styles used by the homepage
  config.js             Runtime config (the bot API base URL)
  theme.js              Theme engine, seasons, "add to home screen"
  apiHelper.js          Small JSON helper for the bot API
  nav-auth.js           Session/auth helper used by the signed-in links
  manifest.webmanifest  Web app manifest (installable "add to home screen")
  media/logo.svg        Site logo, favicon and app icon
  robots.txt
worker.js               Serves public/ as static assets
scripts/build.mjs       Copies public/ + worker.js into build/
```

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:8787
npm run build    # writes build/
npm run deploy   # publishes with wrangler
```

## Stylesheet map

`public/style.css` is the whole site's stylesheet, in this order:

1. **Tokens & base chrome** — `:root` variables, reset, nav, hero, section shell,
   feature cards, commands, docs, CTA band, footer.
2. **Reveal & responsive** — scroll-reveal animation and the 960 / 760 / 380 breakpoints.
3. **Shared page components** — page hero, panels, toolbars, tables, forms.
4. **Status / updates / login / admin** — status badge, uptime bars, changelog, auth screens.
5. **Configure-bot dashboard** — configure.html and linking.html, section cards.
6. **Theme engine & account nav** — button icons, capsule nav, badges, account shell.
7. **Seasonal themes** — Halloween, Christmas and Thanksgiving, each guarded by
   `html[data-season="…"]`, so a season simply stops applying when the attribute is not
   set (theme.js picks it from the calendar).
8. **#rw-fx overlay** — the moving pieces theme.js builds (embers, bats, spider, snow…).
9. **Input, focus & device hardening** — appended block: `color-scheme`, keyboard focus
   rings, safe-area insets and touch-specific hover handling.

A handful of custom properties are set at runtime by theme.js or inline markup rather
than declared in the sheet: `--c --d --del --dur --dx --dy --o --s --sp --sw --sz --x --y`.

## Configuration

- **Bot API** — `public/config.js` holds the bot API base URL in one place
  (`window.RW_API`, currently `https://api.rustyworksrce.xyz`); pages read it from there
  instead of hard-coding a host. If the API is ever unreachable the site keeps working and
  falls back to the published numbers.
- **Hero background video** — the homepage looks for a background video under
  `public/media/`; when it is absent the hero falls back to the dark rust gradient.

## Device support

The layout is fluid from a 320px phone up to large desktop displays.

- **Navigation** collapses to a menu button below 900px; the panel is positioned under
  the header and sized from a shared `--header-h` token.
- **Phone layouts** stack the hero, CTA cards and footer, make the primary hero buttons
  full width, and keep decorative tool mockups out of the way below 640px.
- **Touch input** gets finger-sized targets (44px minimum), no sticky hover lift
  (`@media (hover: none)`) and no tap highlight.
- **Notched / rounded displays** are handled with `viewport-fit=cover` plus
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding on the page gutter, header and footer.
- **Motion** respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, and `color-scheme` plus a `theme-color`
  keep the browser chrome in theme.
- **Installable**: the manifest and icons let the footer's app button install the site to
  a home screen where the browser supports it.

## Source status

`public/style.css` and `public/config.js` are the site's real files, cleaned up and
verified to be behaviour-identical to the originals (same rules, same order, same
declarations). `index.html`, `apiHelper.js`, `nav-auth.js` and `theme.js` in this repo are
still earlier rebuilt copies, so the project is deliberately not deployed in this state.
